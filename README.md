# AllOne(Wallet for Your Passwords)

AllOne is an Android application built in Flutter that manages users' passwords on the cloud using AES encryption. Users can create multiple categories and their corresponding passwords. Users can login using either email or phone number. Here, users can efficiently search for passwords. AllOne Notes enables users to create cloud-based notes. AllOne Authenticator allows users to utilize the TOTP feature for 2FA authentication.
